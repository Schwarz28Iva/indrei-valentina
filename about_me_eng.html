				<h6><i>Hello there!</i></h3> 
				<div class="conditional-content" id="content0">
				<p> Before we start, I want to thank you for taking the time to read my story. Whether you arrived here because of my articles, out of curiosity, or by chance, I hope you find exactly what you're looking for. And if you're seeking a passionate and dedicated employee or collaborator, I hope to be the person you're looking for.
				
				<p> My name is Indrei Valentina Andreea, I'm 24 years old, and I am currently a master's student specializing in Intelligent Software Robotics.
				
				<p> My passion for the IT field started at the age of 8, thanks to video games. At 13, I was assisting technology teachers and continued by enrolling in a high school specializing in mathematics and computer science, with an intensive focus on computer science.</p>
				
				<p> I further pursued my passion by choosing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and graduating from it. During my studies, I obtained various accredited certifications and participated in different courses and training programs. After graduation, I focused on personal projects and self-development.</p>
